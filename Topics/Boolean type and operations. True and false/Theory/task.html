<p>The following variable is <code class="language-java">true</code>:</p>
<pre><code class="language-java">boolean b = true &amp;&amp; !false; // true, because !false is evaluated before &amp;&amp;

<p>To change the order of execution you can use parentheses <code class="language-java">(...)</code>.</p>
<h5 id="an-example-trekking">An example: trekking</h5>
<p>As an example, let's write a complex boolean expression that determines the possibility of trekking in summer and in other seasons. Let's suppose that the right conditions for trekking are dry warm weather in any season or dry weather in summer.</p>
<pre><code class="language-java">boolean cold = false;
boolean dry = true;
boolean summer = false; // suppose now is autumn

<h5 id="short-circuiting-evaluation">Short-circuiting evaluation</h5>
<p>An interesting thing is that the <code class="language-java">&amp;&amp;</code> and <code class="language-java">||</code> operators don't evaluate the second argument if it isn't necessary. When the first argument of the <code class="language-java">&amp;&amp;</code> operator evaluates to <code class="language-java">false</code>, the overall value must be <code class="language-java">false</code>; and when the first argument of the <code class="language-java">||</code> operator evaluates to <code class="language-java">true</code>, the overall value must be <code class="language-java">true</code>. So:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p><code class="language-java">false &amp;&amp; ...</code> -&gt; <code class="language-java">false</code>, since it is not necessary to know what the right-hand side is;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><code class="language-java">true || ...</code> -&gt; <code class="language-java">true</code>, since it is not necessary to know what the right-hand side is.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>This behavior is known as <strong>short-circuit evaluation</strong> (do not confuse it with <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Short_circuit" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" target="_blank">an electrical short circuit</a>). It reduces the computation time, but can also be used to avoid some errors in programs. We will discuss this in the following topics.</p>
<h5 id="conclusion">Conclusion</h5>
<p>The <code class="language-java">boolean</code> data type has only two possible values: <code class="language-java">false</code> and <code class="language-java">true</code>, and is used to represent logical states. The use of logical operators <code class="language-java">!</code> , <code class="language-java">^</code> , <code class="language-java">&amp;&amp;</code>, <code class="language-java">||</code>  allows for the creation of complex logical expressions that take into account multiple factors. Understanding the <a class="theory-lookup" href="/learn/step/3515" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" target="_blank" title="Precedence in Java refers to the order of operations that are performed when evaluating an expression. | It determines which operation should be executed first based on the type of operator used. Java follows a specific set of rules for operator precedence, with some operators having higher precedence than others. For example, arithmetic operators like multiplication and division have higher precedence than addition and subtraction. This means that if an expression contains both types of operators, the multiplication and division operations will be performed first before the addition and subtraction operations.">precedence</a> of these operators enables proper organization of expressions and helps avoid errors.</p>
