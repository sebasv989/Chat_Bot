<p>Quite often you may need to assign different values to a variable depending on a certain condition. You may do it conveniently with the help of the <strong><a class="theory-lookup" href="/learn/step/3512" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" target="_blank" title="The ternary operator, also known as the conditional operator, is a concise way to express simple conditional statements in Java. | It evaluates a condition and chooses one of two cases to execute, acting as a compact form of the 'if-then-else' statement.

<h5 id="what-is-the-ternary-operator">What is the ternary operator?</h5>
<p>The ternary operator is an operator which evaluates a condition and chooses one of two cases to execute. It is also called the <strong><a class="theory-lookup" href="/learn/step/3503" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" target="_blank" title="The conditional operator, also known as the ternary operator, is a concise way to express simple conditional statements in Java. | It evaluates a condition and chooses one of two cases to execute. The operator can be considered a shorthand for the if-then-else statement. It consists of a boolean expression followed by a question mark, then two expressions separated by a colon, where the first expression is executed if the boolean expression is true, and the second expression is executed if the boolean expression is false.">conditional operator</a></strong>. The operator can be considered as a form of the <code class="language-java">if</code>-then-<code class="language-java">else</code> statement. The ternary operator should not be confused with the conditional statement, despite their similarity. This operator can be used in places where an <a class="theory-lookup" href="/learn/step/11635" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" target="_blank" title="An expression in Java is a combination of variables, operators, and method invocations that yield a value when evaluated. | It can be a simple literal, variable, or operator, or a complex mix of these elements.

They can be assigned to variables, passed as arguments to methods, or used in control flow structures like if-else statements and loops. Understanding expressions is crucial for writing effective Java code.">expression</a> is expected.</p>
<p>Sometimes <strong>the ternary operator</strong> is more readable and concise than the corresponding <strong><a class="theory-lookup" href="/learn/step/3503" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" target="_blank" title="The 'if statement' in Java is a conditional statement used to control the flow of a program based on whether a specified boolean expression is true or false. | If the expression evaluates to true, the code block within the if statement is executed, otherwise, it is skipped. The if statement can be used in any place in a program where a statement is expected, and it can even be nested inside another conditional statement to perform multistage checks. The if statement is a fundamental control flow construct in Java, allowing for conditional execution of code based on specific conditions.">if statement</a></strong>.</p>
<p>Let's start learning this operator with an example. Suppose we have to find the <a class="theory-lookup" href="/learn/step/12877" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" target="_blank" title="In Java, the maximum of two numbers can be determined using the `Math.max()` method, which is a built-in method in the `Math` class of the Java standard library. | This method takes two double-precision floating-point numbers as arguments and returns the larger of the two. If both arguments are equal, the method will return the first argument.">maximum</a> of two int variables, <code class="language-java">a</code> and <code class="language-java">b</code>. It is easy to write using a conditional statement:</p>
<pre><code class="language-java">int a = ...;
int b = ...;
int max = ...;

if (a &gt; b) {
    max = a;
} else {
    max = b;
}</code></pre>
<p>Here is what an equivalent ternary operator looks like:</p>
<pre><code class="language-java">int max = a &gt; b ? a : b;</code></pre>
<p>This code is more concise than the code above, isn't it?</p>
<p>The general syntax of the ternary operator is the following:</p>
<pre><code class="language-java">result = condition ? trueCase : elseCase;</code></pre>
<p>It includes two special symbols <code class="language-java">?</code> and <code class="language-java">:</code>.</p>
<p>Here, the <code class="language-java">condition</code> is a Boolean expression that evaluates to either <code class="language-java">true</code> or <code class="language-java">false</code>. If this expression is <code class="language-java">true</code>, the ternary operator evaluates <code class="language-java">trueCase</code>, otherwise <code class="language-java">elseCase</code> is evaluated. It is important that <code class="language-java">trueCase</code> and <code class="language-java">elseCase</code> are expressions which can be reduced to a common <a class="theory-lookup" href="/learn/step/3492" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" target="_blank" title="In Java, a 'type' refers to a classification of data that determines the values it can hold and the operations that can be performed on it. | This can include primitive types (such as int, char, or boolean) and reference types (such as classes, interfaces, or arrays).

This type determines the type of the <code class="language-java">result</code>.</p>
<h5 id="usage-example">Usage example</h5>
<p>Let's consider another example that <a class="theory-lookup" href="/learn/step/13775" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" target="_blank" title="In Java, 'print' is a statement used to display output to the console. | It writes the specified text or variable value to the standard output stream, which is typically the console.

<pre><code class="language-java">int num = ...;  // it's initialized by a value
System.out.println(num % 2 == 0 ? "even" : "odd");</code></pre>
<p>This ternary operator consists of three <a class="theory-lookup" href="/learn/step/3502" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" target="_blank" title="An operand in Java is a value that an operator acts upon. | It can be a variable, a literal value, or the result of an expression. Operands can be of any data type, such as integer, float, boolean, or user-defined types. They are an essential part of expressions, which are built using operators and operands. Operands can be used in various ways, such as unary (one operand), binary (two operands), or ternary (three operands) operations.">operands</a>: the value of the expression <code class="language-java">num % 2 == 0</code>, and two string <a class="theory-lookup" href="/learn/step/3522" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" target="_blank" title="In Java, literal is a representation of a fixed value, such as a number, string, or character, that is used directly in the code. | They are the building blocks of data in Java and can be stored in variables for later use.

Its result type is <code class="language-java">String</code>.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>Note: Java allows us to nest one ternary operator into another one, but it can be less readable than the corresponding conditional statement. If you do this, be careful.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>Imagine you need to compare two <a class="theory-lookup" href="/learn/step/3565" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" target="_blank" title="In Java, an integer number is a type of primitive data type that represents whole numbers, both positive and negative, as well as zero. | The most commonly used integer types are byte, short, int, and long, with int being the default type. These types can store numbers within specific ranges, with int being able to store numbers between -2,147,483,648 and 2,147,483,647.">integer numbers</a> and print <code class="language-java">equal</code> in case they are equal, <code class="language-java">more</code> if the first one has a bigger value than the second and <code class="language-java">less</code> otherwise. The task can be solved using a combination of 2 ternary operators:</p>
<pre><code class="language-java">int a = ...; // it's initialized by a value
int b = ...; // it's initialized by a value
String result = a == b ? "equal" :
                a &gt; b ? "more" : "less";</code></pre>
<p>At first, the outer ternary operator checks equality of <code class="language-java">a</code> and <code class="language-java">b</code> numbers. If it is true, <code class="language-java">equal</code> is printed, otherwise, the nested ternary operator <code class="language-java">a &gt; b ? "more" : "less"</code> is calculated. To improve readability, the whole expression is divided into two lines.</p>
<h5 id="conclusion">Conclusion</h5>
<p>The ternary operator in Java is a concise way to evaluate a condition and assign values to a variable based on that condition. It is similar to an <code class="language-java">if-else</code> statement but can be more readable and concise in certain situations.
